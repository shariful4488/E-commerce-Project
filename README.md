Phimart is a fully functional e-commerce backend built using Django Rest Framework. It includes core e-commerce features like product listings, categories, orders, carts, and user authentication.

## 🔐 Authentication

Phimart uses **JWT Authentication** via [Djoser](https://djoser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). After logging in, users receive access and refresh tokens that must be included in the headers for protected endpoints.

### Sample JWT Auth Headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
📂 API Endpoints
